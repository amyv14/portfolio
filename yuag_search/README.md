## Estelle's Contribution:
Worked with Amy to figure out the live search and get AJAX updates working. I made the search results open in a new tab when clicked by adding target="_blank"> to the home.html page which imporves user experience. Made sure no results show when input fields are empty. I also handled the CSS styling to make the page look cleaner and easier to read. Worked together to debug and test everything along the way.

## Amy's Contribution:
Worked with Estelle to implement the live search functionality using AJAX and Flask. I rewrote some of the find_id function so it returned dictionaries instead of tuples, which made working with JSON and JavaScript much easier. Updated cookies logic. Worked together to set up the JavaScript that handles live fetching and displaying the results as the user types.

## Assessment of Assignment
    * Did it help you to learn? What did it help you to learn?

    We learned how to use AJAX, a web technique neither of us had used before, to dynamically update search results without needing to reload the page. It helped us understand how the frontend and backend can communicate in real time, and how to handle data using JavaScript, jQuery, and Flask together. We also became more comfortable debugging and reading error messages in the Flask console.
