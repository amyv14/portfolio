## Amy Vataksi -- Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio. I’m a Yale CS student interested in systems programming, backend development, and building tools that make information easier to access. This repository highlights a mix of full-stack apps, search tools, and low-level systems work. Each project links to its own directory with documentation and code.

### BowWow Builder — Full-Stack Mobile App

A cross-platform mobile application built with React Native, Expo, Flask, and PostgreSQL.
Users build and share custom meals from Yale’s Bow Wow dining hall, with login, bundle creation, commenting, and ratings all backed by a REST API. The app is deployed on AWS EC2 and uses a live PostgreSQL database.

Tech: React Native, TypeScript, Flask, PostgreSQL, AWS EC2

### YUAG Search Engine — Gallery Metadata Search

A lightweight search tool built for the Yale University Art Gallery.
I designed a custom pipeline to clean, index, and search object metadata, enabling faster lookup of artworks and attributes. Focused on data structure design, query efficiency, and search experience.

Tech: Python, CSV/JSON ingestion, indexing structures, CLI interface

### Systems Programming — Compiler & Shell

A collection of systems-level projects where I implemented a recursive-descent compiler for a BASIC-style language that transpiles to C, and a Unix-style shell supporting job control, parsing, and system calls like fork, exec, and pipe.

Tech: C, parsing, memory allocation, process control, POSIX system calls

## What this portfolio shows

Across these projects, I focus on:
- Clean backend and API design
- Handling real data (parsing, indexing, ingestion)
- Strong systems fundamentals (C, compilers, OS concepts)
- Building complete, usable tools from scratch
- Each folder contains a README with more details :)
